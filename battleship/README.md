what a mess! 1000 lines of code and yet not a single object or class!!!!! my greatest work of art to this date.  

this was made while i was locked in uncle bill's house with no wifi over spring break.  isaac newton invented calculus, gabriel marqeuz wrote 100 years of solitude, and i have this.

there are like 20 private static variables so that they could be called in the public static void main class.  what a masterpiece.

it works though! and it's idiot-proofed because i tested it on adam and he found just about every way to break it.
