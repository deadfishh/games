# wordle

this is scanner wordle written was java and no classes because i was in my non-OOP era.  check back in like two weeks for the javascript version, perchance.

edit; i have made the other version, it's in the stem folder or at https://deadfishh.github.io/stem/wordle

here is a catcher in the rye quote to keep you going:

“It was that kind of a crazy afternoon, terrifically cold, and no sun out or anything, and you felt like you were disappearing every time you crossed a road.”
